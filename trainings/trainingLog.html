      <h2>Logging Information</h2>
      <p>Filling out a detailed log in any care giving setting involves documenting the activities and incidents that occurred during the shift or caregiving session. Here are the steps to follow:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify the person being cared for and the date and time of the caregiving session.</li>
        <li>Record the activities performed during the session, including tasks such as meal preparation, medication administration, toilet and hygiene assistance, and any physical therapy or exercise routines.</li>
        <li>Document any changes in the person's condition or behavior, such as changes in mood, appetite, sleep patterns, or mobility. Note any concerns or observations that may require follow-up by medical professionals or family members.</li>
        <li>Record any incidents or accidents that occurred during the session, including falls, injuries, or other unexpected events. Note what happened, how the person reacted, and any steps taken to address the situation.</li>
        <li>Include notes on any communication with family members, doctors, or other care providers. Record any instructions received or given, and any updates on the person's condition or treatment plan.</li>
        <li>Sign and date the log at the end of the session, and make sure it is properly stored and accessible for future reference.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>Overall, a detailed log should provide a clear and accurate account of the caregiving session, allowing other caregivers, medical professionals, and family members to understand what happened and make informed decisions about the person's care and treatment. This is required.</p>

      <h2>Mandatory reporting</h2>
      <p>Mandatory reporting in a care giving setting refers to the legal requirement for health care professionals to report certain incidents or observations to the relevant authorities.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Suspicion or evidence of abuse or neglect <br>Report to Adult Protective Services (APS) or Department of Human Services (DHS) </li>
        <li>Sexual assault <br>Report to Local Law Enforcement or Police Department </li>
        <li>Suicide or suicidal idealization <br>Report to Local Law Enforcement or Police Department </li>
        <li>Homicide or threats of harm to self or others <br>Report to Local Law Enforcement or Police Department </li>
        <li>Infectious diseases that are Rrport-able by law <br>Report to Local Health Department or Public Health Agency </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The purpose of mandatory reporting is to protect vulnerable individuals from harm, abuse, and neglect. Health care professionals who fail to Report these incidents may face legal consequences, including fines, being unable to work in their field anymore and/or imprisonment. Therefore, it is important for caregivers to be aware of mandatory reporting laws and to report any incidents that they may come across in their practice.</p>
      <p>There are several types of abuse, including:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Physical abuse: The intentional use of physical force to cause injury, pain, or impairment, which may include hitting, slapping, punching, pushing, or restraining a person against their will. </li>
        <li> Emotional/Psychological abuse: A pattern of behavior that undermines an individual's self-esteem and emotional well-being, which may include manipulation, humiliation, intimidation, threatening, or isolating the person from others. </li>
        <li> Sexual abuse: Any unwanted sexual contact or activity, including rape, sexual assault, or forced prostitution, as well as non-contact sexual abuse such as sexual harassment, voyeurism, or exposing oneself. </li>
        <li> Verbal abuse: The use of words or language to threaten, belittle, or humiliate a person, which can lead to emotional trauma and harm. </li>
        <li> Financial abuse: The unauthorized or improper use of an individual's property or resources for personal benefit, often involving theft, fraud, coercion, or manipulation of financial assets. </li>
        <li> Neglect: The failure to provide necessary care and support for physical, emotional, or mental well-being, which may include lack of medical care, inadequate nutrition, social isolation, proper nutrition, hygiene, medical care, or failure to meet basic safety needs. </li>
        <li> Abandonment: This occurs when a caregiver purposefully leaves a care recipient without the necessary support or assistance they require, putting the person's health and safety at risk. </li>
        <li> Self-neglect: This is when the care recipient themself fails to meet their own basic needs, often due to cognitive impairment, mental health issues, or substance abuse. Caregivers may need to intervene and seek professional help to address self-neglect issues. </li>
        <li> Medication abuse: This occurs when a caregiver inappropriately manages a care recipient's medications, such as giving incorrect doses, withholding necessary medications, or overmedicating the person to control their behavior or sedate them. </li>
        <li> Violation of rights: This includes not respecting the care recipient's personal boundaries, privacy, or autonomy, such as making decisions on their behalf without consent, or denying them access to information or the opportunity to participate in decisions that affect their life. </li>
      </ol>
