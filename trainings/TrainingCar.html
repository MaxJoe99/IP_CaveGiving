    <h2>What do do if you get in a car crash</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Stay calm: Take a deep breath and try to remain as calm as possible.</li>
      <li>Check for injuries: Before doing anything else, make sure both you and your passengers are safe and have no serious injuries. If anyone is injured, call for medical assistance immediately.</li>
      <li>Turn on hazard lights: Switch on your car's hazard lights to notify other drivers about the accident and help prevent further accidents.</li>
      <li>Move to a safe area: If possible, move your vehicle to a safe area away from the flow of traffic, like a shoulder or a parking lot. If your car cannot be moved, stay inside with your seatbelt on and wait for help to arrive.</li>
      <li>Call the police: Even if the accident is minor, it's important to call the police and report the incident. They will help control the scene and create a report that you may need later for insurance purposes.</li>
      <li>Exchange information: While waiting for the police, exchange information with the other driver(s) involved in the accident. Be sure to ask for their name, contact details, driver's license number, license plate number, and insurance information.</li>
      <li>Document the scene: Take photos and videos of the accident scene from different angles, including any damages to your vehicle and others involved. Note the location, time, weather conditions, and any witnesses who saw the accident occur.</li>
      <li>File an insurance claim: Contact your insurance company as soon as possible to report the accident and start the claims process.</li>
      <li>Keep a record: Keep a detailed record of your accident, including all relevant documents, receipts, and other evidence. You may need this information for your insurance claim or other legal actions.</li>
      <li>Seek medical attention: Even if you feel fine, it's important to see a doctor after a car accident. Some injuries can take time to manifest, so it's better to be safe than sorry. Remember to keep all medical records and bills related to the accident.</li>
      <li>Consult an attorney: If there are any legal disputes or complications regarding the accident, it might be helpful to consult with an attorney who specializes in personal injury or car accident law. They can advise you on your rights and help protect your interests.</li>
