      <li>Monitor and maintain fluid levels: In addition to engine oil, regularly check other essential fluid levels, such as coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid, and windshield washer fluid. Top them off when necessary and replace them as recommended by your vehicleâ€™s manufacturer.</li>
      <li>Inspect and replace air filter: A clean air filter allows your engine to breathe more efficiently and can improve gas mileage. Check the air filter every few months and replace it when it appears dirty or according to the manufacturer's recommendations.</li>
      <li>Check and maintain tire pressure: Proper tire pressure helps extend the life of your tires and ensures better fuel efficiency. Check tire pressure at least once a month and inflate them to the recommended PSI (pounds per square inch) as specified in your owner's manual or on the driver's side door jamb.</li>
      <li>Rotate and balance tires: Rotating and balancing your tires can help prevent uneven tire wear and extend their lifespan. Follow your vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for tire rotation and balancing intervals.</li>
      <li>Replace windshield wipers: Wiper blades can wear out over time, reducing visibility during rain or snow. Replace them at least once a year or when they start to show signs of wear.</li>
      <li>Inspect and replace brakes: Your brakes are critical for safety. Regularly inspect brake pads, rotors, and other brake components for wear and replace them as necessary to maintain braking performance.</li>
      <li>Keep your car clean: Wash your car regularly to remove dirt, grime, and road salt, which can cause damage to your paint and accelerate rusting. Don't forget to clean the interior, too.</li>
      <li>Inspect and replace belts and hoses: Rubber components like belts and hoses can wear out over time. Inspect them for wear, cracks, or leaks and replace them as needed.</li>
      <li>Perform regular tune-ups: Scheduling regular tune-ups can help maintain your car's engine performance and efficiency. A tune-up typically includes spark plug replacement, air filter cleaning or replacement, and inspection of other engine components.</li>
      <li>Check and replace the timing belt: The timing belt is a critical part of your engine that can cause significant damage if it breaks. Check the manufacturer's recommendations for timing belt replacement intervals and follow them to avoid costly engine repairs.</li>
